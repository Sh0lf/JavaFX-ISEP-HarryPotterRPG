# Harry Potter RPG - JavaFX

This personal project during year 2023 first year engineering cycle at the renowned french engineering school ISEP was to make us accustomed to OOP.

# Mission

Based on this UML:

And many rules and specifics (from an 8 page document...), we have to entirely conceive a game represented firstly in simple console prints then adapting the project with a GUI thanks to JavaFX.

# Run Locally

Clone the project to your machine. It needs to have the current latest version: Java SDK 19.0.2

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Sh0lf/JavaFX-ISEP-HarryPotterRPG
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd my-project
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run start
```

I would however recommend dowloading the project in an archaic method like dowloading the whole zip file and then opening the file through a code editor like IntelliJ to run the program.

# How to play

When you launch the ***main.java*** file, you'll find a prompt in your console asking you to choose how you would like to play:

Afterwards, it gets pretty self-explanatory on how to play the game.

***WARNING***: I still haven't finished the GUI version, only the console version is working flawlessly. So please, don't ask me why the GUI version is not working.

# Demo

Here's a small screenshot of how the game (in console) works:

You then just type what action you want to do.

Hope that you enjoy the game !
